title: What is ERP
description: Ethereum Referral Protocol
---

ERP brings referrals onchain, and allows developers to create custom referral programs using hooks which are called atomically, within a immutable and permissionless protocol.

## The Problem
Developers are faced with building their own referral logic with each of their new applications. And these referral systems are usually opaque, and closed to their community.

## ERP as the Solution
By using ERP as the foundation of an applications referral logic, developers can not only create transparency, but also take advantage of the open source ecosystem of existing implementations.
